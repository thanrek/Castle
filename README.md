# Castle
To install :

-BACKUP YOUR PARK_P.UPK BEFORE DOING ANYTHING

-Download the Castle.zip file aswell as Maptemplates.upk, copy and paste the 5 files (Park_P.upk, meshes.upk, EngineMaterials.upk, Engine_Mi_Shaders.upk and MapTemplates.upk) in your RL directory (C:/Steam/steamapps/common/rocketleague/TAGAme/CookedPCConsole )

-That's it ! Launch the game and go in FreePlay Mode (you might want to relaunch the mode once or twice in order to correctly spawn on the platform), you can also play the map in Exhibition in 2v2, by setting the map to Beckwith Park. (you can't score goals for now though)
